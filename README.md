# Data Cleaning Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a dataset to prepare it for further analysis or modeling. The dataset used in this project contains reviews from Flipkart. The primary objective is to clean the data, handle missing values, and ensure the dataset is ready for analysis. Visualization techniques are also employed to better understand the data.

## Features of the Project

1. **Data Loading:**
   - Imported essential libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
   - Loaded the dataset (`flipkart_reviews.csv`) and displayed its structure for a better understanding of the data.

2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Checked for null values and addressed them effectively.
   - Handled duplicates to ensure data consistency.
   - Renamed columns and standardized formats to enhance readability.
   - Conducted type conversions for specific columns as required.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed unnecessary columns.
   - Applied techniques to address outliers and inconsistencies.
   - Ensured all text fields were clean and free from unwanted characters.

4. **Visualization and Insights:**
   - Used `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to generate visualizations, helping identify patterns and trends in the data.
   - Created distribution plots, bar charts, and heatmaps for deeper insights.

5. **Final Dataset:**
   - Produced a clean, well-structured dataset ready for analysis or model development.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python:** Programming language used for the project.
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: Numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: Data visualization.
